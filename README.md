# Project Proposal

## Title:
Slip

## What and Why:
Most of us download individual bank mobile apps (Chase, Amex, etc.) to manage bank accounts and credit cards, and whenever a payment due date closely reaches, we have the burden to log in to each app and check the current balance. Also, since payment due dates differ for each bank, we most often forget them and access the apps multiple times to remind ourselves. Moreover, since we do not receive notifications of how much we have spent every time we pay with the cards, we tend to forget how much we have spent in total within the past month and even be surprised right before the payment due date. Thus, the app facilitates to increase some awareness of spending, keep track of how much we have spent, and get reminded of when to pay. By linking all bank accounts and credit cards, the users are able to see the spendings in one view. The app will also give notifications whenever a payment/cancellation was made and give an early reminder of the payment due date so that the users are aware.

## For whom:
The app is for any users who have credit/debit cards and want to manage their accounts easily by viewing in one interface and receiving payment notifications.

## How:
Users will link their credit/debit cards and/or bank accounts when creating accounts. They can view spendings for each card, account balance, and payment due dates for each card. If they want, they can enable notifications for whenever a payment/cancellation is made with a card. Also, the users will receive a warning if the current account balance is less than the upcoming monthly payment. Based on how the users are spending money, the app analyzes what categories (ex. food, clothing, entertainment) they pay the most for and provides a financial advice (ex. how they can reduce spending, how much they used compared to previous months). And if given time for this project, the app can recommend better credit cards based on the spending analyses.

## Scope:
I'm not entirely sure how long it will take to code the algorithm, but I believe 4-6 people will be sufficient to build this project. If the project turns out to be less difficult than expected, we can always add more features to the app. It will require a database of categorizing credit card spending and recommending credit cards to the users.
